Hello,

This repository contains the source files needed to build the website
for the Johannesburg Linux User Group (JoziLUG):
[http://www.jozilug.co.za](http://www.jozilug.co.za).  The site is
built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator
written in Ruby, and uses the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
framework.  It is hosted using GitHub Pages.

From the root directory of the site, run ``jekyll build`` to output
the site to the _site subdirectory.  Run ``jekyll serve`` to see the
site hosted locally at 0.0.0.0:4000.

Cheers!
