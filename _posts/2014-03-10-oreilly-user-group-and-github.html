<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
  2014 is off to a great start!  So far, we’ve had two talks this
  year: <a href="https://twitter.com/mxc4">Mark Clarke</a>
  of <a href="http://jumpingbean.co.za/">Jumping Bean</a> gave a talk
  about <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Jozi-Linux-User-Group-JLUG/events/160938542/">Linux
  containers and Docker</a> in January
  and <a href="https://twitter.com/dawidloubser">Dawid Loubser</a>
  (System Architect at Travel Link) told us what he knew
  about <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Jozi-Linux-User-Group-JLUG/events/146834422/">Arch
  Linux</a>.  Next week, new
  member <a href="https://twitter.com/artilery">Bonga</a> will teach
  us a bit about building Linux applications
  with <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Vala">Vala</a>.  Sign
  up <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Jozi-Linux-User-Group-JLUG/events/167272312/">here</a>!
</p>
<p>
  Aside from that, we have two big announcements to make.
</p>
<p>
  The first is that we’ve been accepted
  into <a href="http://oreilly.com/ug/">O’Reilly’s User Group
  programme</a>.  What this means for our dear members is discounts on
  O’Reilly books (both printed and otherwise).  There is 40% discount
  on printed books and 50% on e-books.  If you’d like to review an
  O’Reilly book for us, please take a browse through some of their
  most recently released books and
  message <a href="https://twitter.com/jozilug">us</a>.  After you’re
  done, we’ll post your review on this site and invite you to give a
  talk about what you learned (or didn’t) from the book.
</p>

<p>
  The second major announcement is that we’ve uploaded the source
  for <a href="http://www.jozilug.co.za">this site</a> to Github.  You
  can find the
  repo <a href="https://github.com/jozilug/site">here</a>.  The site
  is built using the Ruby static site
  generator, <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>.  Let us know if
  there is any interest to get involved and we will organise a
  training session to show people how to use git and start customising
  the site. This should be a great way to build the community and
  learn valuable skills at the same time.  Please submit feature
  requests, pull requests, or bugs to the Github site. Time to pay all
  the FOSS goodness forward!
</p>
<p>
  As a final note, starting with the Arch Linux talk, we’re
  experimenting
  with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICaVlkpHX94#t=5m56s">streaming
  the meetups</a>.  Let us know if you have any skills in video
  production or editing or have ever successfully
  run <a href="http://www.openshotvideo.com/">OpenShot</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Why Attend LUG Meetups?  Its a great way to meet like-minded geeks
  and network in
  an <a href="http://readwrite.com/2014/02/20/linux-jobs-report#awesm=~oxFqNOwWmLNaQk">ever-growing</a> <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9246456/Demand_for_Linux_skills_rises">field</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Cheers!
