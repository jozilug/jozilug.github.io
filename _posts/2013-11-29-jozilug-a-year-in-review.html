<p>Friends, geeks, hackers - lend us your time :)!</p>
<p>We’ve had a brilliant year!</p>
<p>
  On 1 January this year, we had 86 members of which 15 were active.
  According to
  current <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Jozi-Linux-User-Group-JLUG/">Meetup</a>
  stats, we’re currently at 187 members and 49 active members; that
  is a twofold increase in total members, and a threefold increase
  in active members!  In addition,
  our <a href="https://twitter.com/jozilug">Twitter account</a> has
  gained 138 followers in the 6 months since our initial tweet.
</p>

<p>
  You may have already heard about our crowning achievement this
  year: JoziLUG played an instrumental role in bringing the Father
  of <a href="http://www.fsf.org/">Free Software</a> himself,
  Richard Stallman, to South Africa.  Over the course of his trip,
  he visited
  Pretoria, <a href="http://www.htxt.co.za/2013/08/31/richard-stallman-says-you-must-fight-etolls/">Johannesburg</a>,
  Durban, Bloemfontein, and Cape Town to talk about the virtues of
  Free Software.  Whether you agree with his perspective or not, his
  presence raised the level of dialogue on these issues in South
  Africa.

  Our members have also provided excellent material for our meetups:
  from a discourse on
  the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Jozi-Linux-User-Group-JLUG/events/92503292/">Raspberry
    Pi</a>
  to <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Jozi-Linux-User-Group-JLUG/events/102114012/">text
    editing</a>/<a href="http://www.meetup.com/Jozi-Linux-User-Group-JLUG/events/121990682/">processing</a>
  and
  <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Jozi-Linux-User-Group-JLUG/events/143181242/">music
    management</a> on GNU/Linux
  to <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Jozi-Linux-User-Group-JLUG/events/125034032/">managing
    Samba</a>
  and <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Jozi-Linux-User-Group-JLUG/events/128044972/">Ansible</a>
  and more.
</p>
<p>
  But there is still work to do.  Our goal with JoziLUG, beyond just
  offering a "safe space" for GNU/Linux afficionados to get together
  and geek out, is to grow the Free and Open Source Software
  environment in South Africa.  We are looking forward to an even
  better 2014 and need help to plan events and activities for the
  new year. Make it your new year resolution to give some of your
  time to help grow the free software community in South
  Africa. Volunteer to be on the LUG committee or
  to <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Jozi-Linux-User-Group-JLUG/events/making/?ed=suggest">give
    a talk</a> at our monthly meetups (we have an open slot for our
  February meetup).
</p>
<p>
  Our first meetup of 2014 is already scheduled
  (<a href="http://www.meetup.com/Jozi-Linux-User-Group-JLUG/events/146834422/">Arch
    Linux</a>, if you’re curious).  Until then, come reflect with us on
  a year of accomplishment over roasting boerewors on 30 November
  for <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Jozi-Linux-User-Group-JLUG/events/150155702/">our
    annual end-of-year braai</a>.

  Cheers!
